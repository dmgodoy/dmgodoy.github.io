              <h3>Toptal - Freelance Backend Engineer</h3>
              <p>
                I am currently working as a freelance backend engineer at
                Toptal. In this role, I collaborate with clients to develop
                robust and scalable backend solutions for their applications. My
                responsibilities include designing and implementing efficient
                architectures, integrating with third-party services, and
                ensuring the security and performance of the systems.

              <h3>CERN - Machine Protection Systems</h3>
              <p>
                Previously, I worked at CERN, where I contributed to the
                development of machine protection systems. This involved
                designing and implementing software solutions to ensure the
                safety and stability of particle accelerators. I gained valuable
                experience in working with cutting-edge technologies and
                collaborating with a multidisciplinary team of scientists and
                engineers.

              <p>
                Prior to my role in machine protection systems at CERN, I had
                another contract at CERN working on the development of software
                for a new particle acceleration technology called Awake. The
                research conducted in this project was groundbreaking and
                resulted in a publication in the prestigious Nature magazine. It
                was an exciting opportunity to contribute to advancing
                scientific knowledge in particle physics.

                Before my time at CERN, I worked at Bitnami, a company that
                specialized in web application packaging, configuration, and
                deployment. I played a crucial role in ensuring the seamless
